# Multi-Tier Architecture Deployment

This project provides Terraform configurations for deploying a multi-tier architecture on cloud platforms. It includes modules for setting up virtual machine instances and other infrastructure components to build scalable, secure, and maintainable applications.

## Features

- Automated deployment of multi-tier architectures
- Modular Terraform configurations
- Support for virtual machine instances
- Scalable and secure infrastructure setup

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the desired module (e.g., `vm_instances`)
3. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
4. Plan the deployment: `terraform plan`
5. Apply the changes: `terraform apply`
